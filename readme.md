# Data Creator

This a project to aid with the creation of artificial datasets for learning purposes - probably.

The aim is to create the utility with as few additional modules as possible, and only use the core python utilities.

An example:

![image](Hippoplotamus.jpg)

The image has a mean of 0.43 in the x-axis, and 0.48 in the Y with a correlation of 0.2. Currently the output is saved as a csv file.

This is very much a beginner project 

## Looking for

- Collaborators/mentors who can help with all the elements of development.
	- project organisation
	- general coding
	- mentoring?

## Goals

- Add the ability to load other datasets e.g. the iris dataset.
- Make the UI useful
- Would be nice to have the axis variable names actually along the axis oriented as a normal graph would. Not sure how hard/easy this would be to program.
- Add option to enable/disable secondary variable.
